        "I felt curious at first because needles aren’t my go-to treatment. But thanks to a friend who suggested I have a consultation at Enfield Royal Clinic. I made my decision then and there to get my first PRP hair treatment, and I must say, I’m excited for my follow-up sessions. The experience was great! It’s a pain-free treatment, and doctors are so kind here.",

        "My hair feels so thick and healthy!!! I’m glad I came to Enfield Royal Clinic for my PRP treatment… I can freely wear my hair down or tie it in a bun. Finally, my hair has volume, and I love combing my fingers through my hair lately.",
